This decrease in excitatory input from the photoreceptors causes off-center bipolar cells to become less active.", "What happens to on centre bipolar cells when the centre is in the dark ?": "When the center of an ON bipolar cell is in the dark, it becomes hyperpolarized. This is due to the continuous release of glutamate from photoreceptors in the dark, which activates metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR6) on the bipolar cell, leading to hyperpolarization. In contrast, when the center of an OFF bipolar cell is in the dark, it becomes depolarized due to the continuous release of glutamate from photoreceptors in the dark, which depolarizes the cell.", "What happens to off centre bipolar cells and ganglion cells when the centre is dark ?": "When the center of the retina is dark, off-center bipolar cells and ganglion cells become more active.
