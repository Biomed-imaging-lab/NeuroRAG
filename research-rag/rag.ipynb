    "One of the challenges faced by individual scientists and research organizations daily is the need for quick and reliable information support to address their tasks. Current solutions, such as Internet search engines, may offer unreliable information limited to online sources, while LLMs (large language models) are prone to \"hallucinations.\" RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) solutions, however, address these shortcomings by generating answers based on verified data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, a decision was made to develop an AI assistant based on the RAG system, based on information from grant and university websites for solving organizational issues, as well as literary sources from the field of biology. The main tasks solved by the AI assistant:\n",
    "- Providing support for organizational tasks related to grant submissions (grant aggregation, selection recommendations, document preparation assistance);\n",
    "- Answers to questions of a specialized, scientific nature."
